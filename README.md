# FindYourWay
FindYourWay is program based on genetic algorithms. In this program, entities have to get from start point to end point thru various obstacles.
Entities have its genom, that indicates, how will they behave. The most successfull entities will survive, while the others will be deleted forever.
Entities that survive will breed and create new, better entities.

Entities evolve themself thru generations, so they adapt to current environment. When user changes the environment, entities adapt themselfs to different
environment without need to change their behave algorithm.
